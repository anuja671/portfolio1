    <p class=" fs-5">HTML & CSS:I have a solid understanding of web development fundamentals, including HTML5 and CSS3. I can create semantic, accessible, and responsive web pages that look great on any device. Using CSS, I ensure my designs are visually appealing and maintain excellent performance across different browsers.
JavaScript: am proficient in JavaScript, with experience in both front-end and back-end development. I have worked with frameworks such as React.js, enabling me to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces. I also enjoy exploring newer technologies like TypeScript and Node.js, which further help me develop scalable web applications.
Version Control & Collaboration:I am familiar with Git and GitHub, tools that allow me to work efficiently in teams and track changes. I follow best practices such as creating clear commit messages and working with branches to keep my workflow organized. Collaboration through pull requests and code reviews is something I value, ensuring code quality and team productivity.
Problem Solving & Debugging:My approach to development goes beyond just writing code â€” it involves problem-solving. I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding creative solutions. My debugging skills allow me to efficiently resolve issues in my projects and optimize them for performance.
Database ManagementI have hands-on experience working with both relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases. I am capable of designing, managing, and querying databases efficiently to store and retrieve data for web applications.
